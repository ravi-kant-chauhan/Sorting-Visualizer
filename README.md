# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview
The Sorting Visualizer is a simple web application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It allows users to witness the step-by-step process of how different sorting techniques arrange elements in a list or array.



## Features
- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Adjustable speed controls to slow down or speed up the visualization process.
- Randomize and reset options to generate new lists.
- Increase and decrease the size of the lists.
- Informative statistics, such as array size and algorithm comparisons/operations.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
The Sorting Visualizer currently supports the following sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options.
4. Set the desired array size or keep the default value.
5. Use the speed controls to adjust the visualization speed.
6. Click the "New Array" button to create a new random array.
7. Press any algorithm button to begin the visualization process.
8. Watch the sorting algorithm in action and observe how the elements get arranged in order.
9. Experiment with different algorithms and array sizes to gain insights into their performance.
